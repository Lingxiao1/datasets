You will need the Spellman data from [here](http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/data/rawdata/combined.txt) and the crabs data from [here](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/PRNN/crabs.dat).\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.131\r\n\r\nMoved functionality from mappingLoadData, ivmLoadData and ncnmLoadData into mapLoadData.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.13\r\n\r\nAdded processing for CMU data base motion capture figure 35. To load, the data should be downloaded from the CMU motion capture data base, http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu, and placed in baseDir/mocap/cmu/35/, where baseDir is the directory where you have placed 'datasetsDirectory.m'. You need the amc files and the asf file.\r\n\r\nRemoved Example 86 motion 10 from the CMU motion capture data base.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.121\r\n\r\nModified robot traces example to reflect the fact that the data which is missing is genuinely missing rather than just reading low.\r\n\r\n#### Release 0.12\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a problem in earlier releases in terms of where the datasets were placed. This has now (hopefully) been fixed using the datasetsDirectory command which returns the directory in which that command is placed. All the data should be placed in that directory.\r\n\r\n#### Release 0.11\r\n\r\nA new data set has been added, motion capture in x,y,z, format of a run. This [data](http://accad.osu.edu/research/mocap/mocap_data.htm) is from Ohio state's Advanced Computing Center fro the Arts and Design web-site.\r\n\r\nThe mapLoadData.m command has been added to load in data for regression and classification problems.\r\n\r\n#### Release 0.1\r\n\r\nFirst release of the toolbox.\r\n\r\nThe toolbox currently contains two different files for loading datasets into matlab and a collection of matlab data sets.\r\n\r\nPage updated on Wed May 19 09:36:44 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
